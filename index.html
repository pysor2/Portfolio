            <h1> Good Morning!</h1>
            <p>
                My name is <span class="name">Rosé</span>.
                I was born 2006 (do the math yourself).
                I've had an interest in programming since I first started using computers at a young age and consider myself a jack of all trades when it comes to technology:
                I usually have an easy time picking up new programs and understanding the workings of new technologies and programming languages,
                but often have a hard time fully mastering any one of them.

            <h1>Prior experience</h1>
            <p>
                I have studied "Informations- och medieteknik" at Westerlundska Gymnasiet in Enköping.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am currently studying a 4th year at NTI gymnasiet in Uppsala

                <h1> Fjellporten biluthyrning</h1>
                <p>
                    This was a website made for school,
                    it's a website for a car rental where customers could choose between different car categories and choose cars within those categories.

                <h1> Delikat flora</h1>
                <p>
                    This too was a project made for school,
                    It's a flower shop website.
                    On the website,
                    customers would be able to find prices for multiple different types of flowers and bouquets,
                    find rates for consultation,
                    or see if flower delivery is available for a certain address.
