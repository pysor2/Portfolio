                My name is <span class="name">Rosé</span>.
                I was born 2006 (do the math yourself) and hate talking about myself so will keep this short.
                <br><br>
                I have studied "Informations- och medieteknik" at Westerlundska Gymnasiet in Enköping.

                <h1> Fjellporten biluthyrning</h1>
                <p>
                    This was a website made for school,
                    it's a website for a car rental where customers could choose between different car categories and choose cars within those categories.
                    It currently does not work 100% correctly as the database which it used is no longer active.

                <h1> Delikat flora</h1>
                <p>
                    This too was a project made for school,
                    It's a flower shop website.
                    On the website,
                    customers would be able to find prices for multiple different types of flowers and bouquets,
                    find rates for consultation,
                    or see if flower delivery is available for a certain address.
                    This page also no longer works because of its database no longer being active.
